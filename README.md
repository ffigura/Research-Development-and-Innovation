"Law 9478, of 08/06/1997, established for the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), among others, the attribution of stimulating research and the adoption of new technologies for the sector. In view of this, the contracts entered into between the Agency and the Oil Companies for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas have, since Round Zero, Research, Development and Innovation clauses (RD&I Clause - PD&I in Portuguese) that establish the obligation to carry out of expenses qualified as RD&I by the Oil Companies.

The RD&I clause establishes the application of a percentage of the gross revenue from production, according to the specific conditions of each type of contract. The ANP is responsible for analyzing, approving, monitoring and supervising the application of resources arising from the RD&I clause."
